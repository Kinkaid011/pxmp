          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            I drove user-centered design strategies for Pro Xtra, the company's
            premier B2B loyalty program serving over 14 million professional
            customers—our most valuable customer segment. The internal tool that
            manages this program is called ProXtra Management Portal, or PXMP,
            for short. Although this tool test very well for it’s usability,
            it’s currently only available on desktop. This has led to low CSAT
            scores, Increases in customer support tickets, and negative
            associate feedback. My job, and the ultimate goal for this tool was
            to make it mobile responsive to allow more in-store associates to
            use it. That way more customers can be assisted in a timely fashion,
            and to push the new business goal of expanding the consumer base
            primarily B2B to  include B2C.

            <h3>Challenge</h3>
            <p>
              The challenge was determining the best approach to transition PXMP
              to mobile, while considering the contrainsts with resources,
              refocusing target users, and the potential expansion of the
              customer base. The resources are referring to Home Depot’s two
              design systems: ANT Design and MUI Design, each with there
              specific purpose for building applications. There are 5 different
              user groups that use PXMP, but this transition shifts focus to
              primarily in-store associates. Lastly, expanding the customer base
              will greatly change the process in how PXMP is used.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3>Solution</h3>
            <p>
              From my initial research into the users, the current resources,
              and the previously finished research we deterimined that the best
              approach would be a mobile optimized app instead of trying to make
              PXMP mobile responsive. This ensure that the in-store associates
              will have the most streamlined and intuitive experience while
              troubleshooting customer issues. Also considering how the current
              design systems are used by the engineers, and the flood of new
              associates using the tool I believe this would be best approach.
              Through this I provide vision and strategy for PXMP. Other big
              contributions were the collaboration and stakeholder align.

        <h2>Verifying the Problem</h2>

        <p>
          When I joined the team, I was told PXMP needed to be made
          mobile-responsive using components. At that point the problem seemed
          simple, how to make this tool transition to mobile. However, one of my
          first few tasks was to determine which components needed redesigning,
          which confused me. Given that they used ANT Design and MUI Design—both
          well-documented and sophisticated systems, I wondered why redesigns
          were necessary. Perhaps they meant redesigning patterns instead, which
          were the combinations of different components.
        </p>

        <p>
          Seeking clarity, I spoke with other designers but got no clear answers
          since the lead designer who was over the program was on leave. I then
          reached out to the engineers on slack and had a quick meeting on there
          since that was there favorite way to interact. When i came to
          components they shared my thoughts—they opposed custom components and
          there was no need to redesign them because of the newly acquired
          design systems. However, they also noted that making PXMP responsive
          would be challenging, as ANT Design wasn’t made for mobile use cases.
        </p>

        <p>
          During our next UX team meeting, I shared these insights and decided
          to meet with PMs and stakeholders. The goal was to align on goal,
          expectations, and also understanding about components. The meeting
          first started by me asking questions about they’re understanding of
          components, so that when I relayed what I learned from the engineers,
          It would be easier to get on the same page. It helps when all parties
          of a discussion feel heard and more involved rather than a supposed
          expert lecturing them. After that I learned about their goals and
          expectations for the project.
        </p>

        <p>
          Their biggest concern was all the request from other departments and
          associates for a mobile version of PXMP. They assured me this is a
          long term project and that they wanted Q1 to focus mainly on
          discovery. This led to the first major pivot: instead of redesigning
          components, our focus shifted to determining the best way to
          transition PXMP to a mobile responsive design given the constraints.
        </p>

      <div class="user-research section">
        <h2>User Research</h2>
        <p>
          After meeting with the PMs to make sure we were on the same page with
          the components, I wanted to go over any and all of the existing
          research. The goal was to get a better understanding of the new target
          users, PXMP, and the design systems so that we could determine the
          gaps in our knowledge. It turns out that there had been quite a bit of
          research done on the already.  Here’s a breakdown of the user research
          we started with:
        </p>

      <div class="insights section">
        <p>
          The main problem that interrupts the in-store associates workflow is
          having to contact the call center to make edits to customer accounts
          because their permissions are limited. Another big issues for pro
          associates is the fact that they are multi-tasking and having to go
          back and forth from the desktop to the aisles helping customers. They
          also have sales and sign-up targets on their minds. Having PXMP on
          mobile with give them more flexibility when assisting customers
          because they could at least stay out on the floor and complete task in
          a single location.

      <div class="app-audit section">
        <h2>Application Audit</h2>
        <p>
          While we continued learning more about our users and their pain
          points, we also made time to study PXMP as is, and gain a deeper
          understanding of it’s usability. A great source of valuable
          information was the System Usability Scale(SUS) that was available
          from previous research. That way we can brainstorm how a mobile
          transition will affect it’s features and functionality. Here are some
          important points from the SUS score.

          Despite the many request to update the internal tool to fit mobile
          devices, that wasn’t an implication that PXMP didn’t perform well with
          users. In fact, with a score of 89.05, it performs amazingly well!
          This indicates that larger, more systematic factors are at play when
          it comes to making this tool more effective.

        <h2>Design Systems</h2>
        <p>
          Normally the biggest constraints designers face are time and budget.
          However, I also like to fully grasp the resources involved. In this
          case I mean the engineers and the design systems we’re working with.
          ANT Design is an enterprise level design system made for handling
          large data heavy designs on desktop. Despite it also having a version
          for mobile, however, that version wasn’t available here. Instead, Home
          Depot uses two different systems, one for desktop(ANT Design), and one
          for mobile(MUI Design).

          A mobile responsive approach to this transition is usually the
          simplest and easiest way to transition a desktop website or
          application to mobile. That goes for all parties involved. However, in
          this case, using two different systems leaves more room for errors and
          inconsistencies. At this point I was having serious doubts about the
          responsive approach, and that would eventually lead to the second
          pivot point. Which was determining the best approach for this
          transition: mobile responsive, mobile-optimized, or a hybrid option.

            Throughout this time of gaining a better understanding of our
            research and the pivots that came with it. There was a pleasant
            constant that kept everything aligned. That was the fact that this
            tool would still need to be redesigned for mobile devices. That
            meant we would need to prioritize the information and content to
            determine how to best use our limited screen size. A big task would
            be to redesign the large data heavy tables within PXMP. Using an
            analytic tool called New Relic, allowed us to see the numbers about
            how this tool is being used in real time.

          <p>
            New Relic is a cloud-based software platform that helps businesses
            monitor, debug, and improve their applications and infrastructure.
            Here we used this tool to inform us on the most visited pages and
            tabs within PXMP. It also gave us an insight into the ways users
            look up customer information. Shown in the images below we can see
            that the purchase history tab is the most popular, and that customer
            accounts are found mainly with their phone numbers

            brief time there and the people I worked with. The rest of this case

        <p>
          As I’ve pointed out before, transitioning data heavy elements and
          complex visuals to fit mobile screens sizes is one of the biggest
          task. The way to solve this issue is through prioritizing the
          information that’s most essential to the user and their workflow. We
          learned from New Relic that purchase history is one of the most
          frequent tabs that our users navigate too. For example, looking up old
          purchases to verify receipts from rewards. Understanding the why
          behind these different workflows are key to understanding what
          information we should prioritize.

          In the example above, so much information is clearly visible, and
          added features like filtering help find specific items faster. On a
          mobile device the visibility will decrease drastically, which can
          increase the time it takes to complete task. This is the reason I
          would not only take qualitative research approaches to understanding
          how users complete task, but quantitative approaches to learn what
          aspects of the task we should focus on. I would use Tree Testing and
          Card Sorting methods to get a complete picture of their terminology,
          grouping structures, and informational hierarchies.

          I believe the best approach would be to make PXMP mobile-optimized
          rather than mobile responsive. Although my opinion should be looked
          into further and discussed more, this is the direction I’m leaning
          too. Considering the current long term goals, the complexity of the
          workflows, user needs, and engineering resources the pros out weigh
          the cons. There isn’t an immediate press for time, and given the fact
          that more associates will use the tool, it would be wise to have an
          internal tool that is intuitive and streamlined. If PXMP is made
          responsive as is, the mobile experience will be clunky and full of
          friction. Add that to the quick timeouts that associates experience
          will only slow the process down further. This will only lead to more
          frustration and more negative feedback for the associates.

          <p>
            As stated earlier in this case study, editing power is a crucial
            factor in evolving how PXMP affects it’s consumer base. One reason
            as to why it’s complicated to change the editing ability of
            different users is because the current customers are B2B. Meaning
            when someone walks in needing help, they are doing so on behalf of a
            company or business. This of course would be a bigger liability to
            allow that person to change primary account information. However,
            with the expanded customer base being B2C, those customers would
            have potentially less complicated accounts. Thus decreasing the
            liability when make changes to those accounts.
